# Cluthar
###### A personal dashboard

Display useful information in a widget system, like wi, sun & moon states, and many more (to come).

The main purpose of this project is to level up in the Vue ecosystem . Currently, the biggest libraries of the ecosystem are used, such as **Vuetify** or **VueUse**. Everything is in **TypeScript** with an ESLint configuration by Antfu.

There is a huge to-do list, but the main goal is to have something working! Some widgets might not be useful at all for you (like transportation data from Bordeaux, France), it's for me, sorry!
